# crafting interpreters

this repo is the results of me working throgh <https://craftinginterpreters.com>.

it will have two projects:

- tslox - the java half of things, ported to typescript
- rslox - the C half of things, ported to rust

this is partially cause I have the environments set up for those already, and
partly just cause porting sounds like a good challenge.
